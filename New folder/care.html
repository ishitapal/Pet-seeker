      <h4><mark>Why is it important to feed your pet a high quality food?</mark><h4>
      <p>It’s important because one definite way any pet owner can affect the longevity and quality of life for their pet is by providing the highest quality food they can. The quality of the food you feed makes a direct difference in your pet’s health. Quality is the key word, quality of the ingredients that go into the making of the pet food you feed. The old saying “You are what you eat” applies to our pets in the same ways as it does for ourselves. Better quality foods made with better quality ingredients provide a better quality of life. The result is fewer skin conditions, less itching, fewer ear infections, shinier coats, less inflammatory bowel disease, better muscling and muscle tone, stronger bones, more energy, better temperament and other immediate physical benefits of better nutrition. Dogs are happier and feel better overall.</p>

      <p>Choosing a veterinarian is one of the most important decisions you'll make for your cat or dog. Your veterinarian will be an important partner for you in making sure your pet lives a long, healthy life.<br>
        <h4><mark>How Do I Know if a Vet Is Right for My Pet?</mark></h4>
        Here are some things to consider when you're choosing a vet: 
        <ul>
        <li>Arrange a visit to the vet without your pet so you can tour the office. This is a great time to notice if the office is clean and well-organized. You can talk to the staff and see if they seem friendly and helpful. </li>
        <li>Ask about the services they offer. If your pet needs an X-ray or other test, can they do it at the office, or will you have to go somewhere else?</li>
      <li>  Find out the office hours and how emergencies are covered. If it's a practice with more than one vet, you may want to ask if you can see a specific vet.</li>
      <li>  Find out if their philosophy matches yours. Veterinarians are simply people whose personalities can vary. Some are warm while others are very businesslike. Look for a vet whose attitude feels like a match.</li></ul></p>

      <h4><mark>WHY TOYS ARE NECESSARY FOR YOUR PET?</mark></h4>
      <p>Giving your pet toys to play with isn't only about making them happy. Toys, and playing in general, provide our pets with a way to meet some of their most elementary needs, from the need to be physically active to staying mentally stimulated.

        <h4><mark>WHY TRAINING IS NEEDED?</mark></h4><BR>Training is an essential part of owning a pet and can be started at any age. Training builds confidence, provides mental stimulation and strengthens the human-animal bond.The consequence of not training a pet can result in everything from annoyance and frustration on the part of an owner to severe and preventable behavioral problems which can result in injury or death to your pet, family, other people or other pets.</p>
